[Distributional Bellman Operator over Mean Embeddings]()

This is developed on top of [DQN Zoo](https://github.com/google-deepmind/dqn_zoo).

NOTE: Only Python 3.9 and above and Linux is supported.

## Installation

Prerequisites for these steps are a NVIDIA GPU with recent CUDA drivers.

1. Follow steps 1-4 of the Quick start of DQN Zoo.

    Install [Docker](http://docs.docker.com/) version 19.03 or later (for the `--gpus` flag).

    Install [NVIDIA Container Toolkit](https://github.com/NVIDIA/nvidia-container-toolkit).

    Enable [sudoless docker](http://docs.docker.com/engine/install/linux-postinstall/#manage-docker-as-a-non-root-user).

    Verify the previous steps were successful e.g. by running: \
    `docker run --gpus all --rm nvidia/cuda:11.1.1-base nvidia-smi`

2. Clone this repo and go to the directory

    ```
    git clone https://github.com/deepmind/sketch_dqn.git
    cd sketch_dqn
    ```

The directory tree closely follows that of DQN Zoo, so it is also possible to move
the `dqn_zoo/sketch_dqn` file under the existing `dqn_zoo` if you have DQN ZOO
installed.

## Usage
Run `run.sh`. The default hyperparameters are as reported in the paper.

We note the following key implementations details for Sketch-DQN.

* Various sketch feature functions are in `dqn_zoo/feature_maps.py`, together with
the computations of sketch Bellman coefficients $B_r$ and value-readout coefficients $\beta$.

* Network objects are located in `dqn/sketch_dqn/networks.py`. The network
used by Sketch-DQN is function `sketch_atari_network`, which relies on
existing modules already defined in DQN Zoo.

* The Sketch-DQN agent uses both the network and pre-computed coefficients.
